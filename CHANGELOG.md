### Cloudflare Pages — Platform migration from Netlify

**Breaking change:** adapter swapped from `@astrojs/netlify` to `@astrojs/cloudflare`. API routes now run as Cloudflare Pages Functions.

**`astro.config.mjs`:**
- Replaced `import netlify from '@astrojs/netlify'` with `import cloudflare from '@astrojs/cloudflare'`
- Changed `adapter: netlify()` to `adapter: cloudflare()`

**`package.json`:**
- Removed `@astrojs/netlify`
- Added `@astrojs/cloudflare` v13.x (Astro 6 compatible)
- Renamed package to `astro-base-template-cloudflare`

**Configuration files:**
- Removed `netlify.toml`
- Removed `vercel.json` (not relevant for Cloudflare Pages)
- Added `wrangler.toml` for Cloudflare Pages / Wrangler CLI configuration

**`public/_headers`:**
- Updated comment — file is fully supported by Cloudflare Pages (no changes to rules)

**API routes:**
- Updated comments in `book-now.ts` and `booking-complete.ts` to reference Cloudflare Pages Functions
- Runtime behaviour unchanged — `import.meta.env` works identically on Cloudflare Pages

**`.gitignore`:**
- Replaced `.netlify` with `.wrangler` and `.dev.vars`

**Documentation:**
- `README.md` — rewritten for Cloudflare Pages deployment
- `deployment.md` — rewritten with Cloudflare dashboard steps

### Three-Builder Design System — Awwwards + Webflow + Oxygen Builder Synthesis

**`ui-designer.md` additions:**
- Added "Scroll Storytelling (Webflow Standard)" section — narrative arc planning, progressive reveal, whitespace maximalism, gradient headline accent (one per page rule)
- Added "Palette Restraint and Spacing Discipline (Oxygen Standard)" section — max 3 active colours, Tailwind spacing scale only, card grid consistency non-negotiable
- Extended Visual Quality Checklist with Webflow checks (narrative arc, whitespace section, gradient accent) and Oxygen checks (card consistency, palette restraint, spacing scale compliance)

**`frontend-builder.md` additions:**
- Updated role description to reference all three design schools (Awwwards, Webflow, Oxygen)
- Added "Webflow Patterns" section: gradient headline accent (`-webkit-background-clip` with fallback), smooth scroll CSS with `prefers-reduced-motion` toggle, scroll storytelling multi-threshold IntersectionObserver
- Added "Oxygen Builder Patterns" section: token compliance rule, spacing scale discipline, card grid consistency enforcement, palette restraint max 3 colours
- Updated Output section to include Webflow editorial and Oxygen structural requirements

**`.gitignore`:**
- Added `.netlify` to gitignore

## [1.3.0] — 2026-04-06

### Added — Cookie Consent Manager (Astro port of hmdg-cookie-consent)

**New files:**
- `src/config/cookie-consent.config.ts` — single marketing config file (GTM ID, GA4 ID, policy version, banner copy, categories, booking platforms)
- `src/components/CookieConsent.astro` — banner, preferences modal, reopen button, full JS logic
- `src/pages/api/book-now.ts` — Netlify Function: relays `book_now_click` to GA4 Measurement Protocol
- `src/pages/api/booking-complete.ts` — Netlify Function: relays `booking_completed` to GA4 Measurement Protocol
- `CookieConsentReadme.md` — plain-English marketing team setup guide
- `.claude/memory/cookieconsent.md` — full implementation plan

**Updated files:**
- `astro.config.mjs` — added `@astrojs/netlify` adapter for Netlify Functions
- `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` — added Google Consent Mode v2 head script (`is:inline`) and `<CookieConsent />` component
- `.env.example` — added `GA4_API_SECRET`, `GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID`, `SITE_ORIGIN`

**Features:**
- GDPR/PECR compliant consent banner with full preferences modal
- Google Consent Mode v2 — all signals default to `denied`, restored from cookie before GTM loads
- 5 consent categories: Necessary (always on), Functional, Analytics, Performance, Marketing
- Universal Booking Tracker — 8 platforms (Cliniko, Calendly, Acuity, Phorest, YouCanBook.me, Jane, Timely, SimplyBook.me)
- postMessage completion detection for 7 platforms; Cliniko uses URL pattern detection
- GA4 client_id parsed correctly from `_ga` cookie (not a generated UUID)
- GCLID and UTM parameters persisted to sessionStorage and forwarded with all booking events
- `hmdg_consent_method` event (accept-all / reject-all / customise) and `hmdg_time_to_consent` event in GA4
- Booking event deduplication via sessionStorage (survives page navigation)
- Mobile bottom sheet layout (≤768px) — slides up from bottom
- `prefers-reduced-motion` respected — all animations disabled
- Full keyboard accessibility: focus trap in modal, Escape closes, focus returns to opener
- `role="status"` live region for screen reader announcements
- Debug console mode (`debug: true` in config) with grouped output and visual dev badge
- `window.hmdgCCM` public API for debugging (`getState`, `acceptAll`, `rejectAll`, `openModal`)
- GA4 API secret never exposed to browser — all MP calls made server-side via Netlify Functions
- Origin validation on API routes — rejects cross-origin requests

**Improvements over the WordPress plugin:**
- No `!important` in CSS — clean scoped styles
- Design tokens from global.css (no hardcoded colours)
- GCLID + UTM forwarding (not in WP plugin)
- Consent method and time-to-consent events (not in WP plugin)
- Booking deduplication via sessionStorage (WP plugin uses JS variable, resets on navigation)
- Correct GA4 client_id from `_ga` cookie (WP plugin generates UUID)
- Cliniko detection via URL pattern (WP plugin incorrectly used postMessage for Cliniko)
- Mobile bottom sheet instead of centred modal
- HMAC-ready architecture (stateless, works on Netlify Functions)

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-06

### Session 2 — Agent system, design standards, and project cleanup

#### AI Agent system (10-agent pipeline)
- Added `visual-qa-reviewer` agent — sits between `frontend-builder` and `a11y-reviewer`, checks built output against design intent, rates output quality
- Rewrote `ui-designer.md` — now includes clinic section anatomy, section variety rules, hero standards, mobile-first guidance, full design token awareness, component standards, animation direction, and visual quality checklist
- Strengthened `frontend-builder.md` — added existing class system reference, Swiper.js guidance, `decoding="async"` in image pattern, transition standards, responsive breakpoint order, 44px touch target rule
- Strengthened `a11y-reviewer.md` — WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 / 3:1), `prefers-reduced-motion` check, form a11y (labels, aria-required, aria-describedby), focus ring contrast (3:1), touch target sizes, severity levels
- Updated all 10-agent sequences across `CLAUDE.md`, memory files, and `index.astro`

#### Documentation (index.astro)
- Updated hero: "HMDG Base Template" title, version badges (Astro v5, Tailwind v4, 10 AI Agents, v1.0.0)
- Added 6 new documentation sections: Utility Classes, Design Tokens, global.css Structure, Image Format Rules, Security Reference, Agent System
- Fixed `<pre><code>` CSS blocks — escaped curly braces with HTML entities to prevent Astro parse error
- Removed all inline `style=""` attributes — replaced with class-based alternatives and CSS variable approach

#### Global CSS improvements
- Added custom scrollbar styling globally — 6px thin thumb, transparent track, rounded pill, slate colour scale with hover/active states
- Firefox: `scrollbar-width: thin` on `*` (not just `html`) so all scroll containers match
- WebKit: `::-webkit-scrollbar` pseudo-elements apply to all scroll containers including sidebar

#### Sidebar navigation
- Active and hover states changed from `--color-primary` (red) to `--color-headline` (dark) — number spans use `--color-caption` as default

#### Project cleanup
- Removed Copilot-era Python files: `analyze_styles.py`, `style_analyzer.py`
- Removed generated analysis artifacts: `inline-styles-analysis.json`, `style-analysis-report.json`, `QUICK_REFERENCE.txt`, `README_ANALYSIS.md`, `STYLE_ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md`, `ANALYSIS_COMPLETE.txt`
- Fixed `cookie-policy.astro` empty `style=""` attribute

#### Standards sync
- Added `decoding="async"` to CLAUDE.md required picture pattern
- Fixed `conversion-reviewer` card to list CTA clarity before CTA placement (matches agent file)
- All agent descriptions in `index.astro` updated to match actual agent file content
