# CLAUDE.md

## Stack
Astro 6 + Tailwind v4 · static-first · premium UK clinic sites for HMDG.
Hosting: Cloudflare Pages (`@astrojs/cloudflare`).
Contact form: Web3Forms (`PUBLIC_WEB3FORMS_KEY` env var — public key, safe to expose).
API routes: Cloudflare Pages Functions (`export const prerender = false`).

## Project Log Protocol (Mandatory)

A lightweight project log lives at `.project-log.md` (project root). It is committed to GitHub but never deployed — it sits outside `src/` and `public/`, so neither Astro nor Cloudflare Pages can serve it.

### Rules — apply on every session

1. **Read first.** Before starting any work, read `.project-log.md`. The Current Priorities, Unfinished / To Do, and Blocked sections describe the running state of the project. Resume from there.
2. **Update last.** Before declaring a task complete (or before ending the session), append a Change Log entry and reconcile the Unfinished / To Do list. Move newly-finished items out, add anything that's still open in.
3. **Unfinished work is always written down.** If a task isn't fully shipped (e.g. uncommitted changes, missing per-client assets, a follow-up the user said yes to), it MUST live under "Unfinished / To Do" with enough detail for the next session to resume cold.
4. **Every Change Log entry includes:**
   - **Date** (YYYY-MM-DD heading)
   - **Status** — `completed` / `in progress` / `blocked` / `to do`
   - **Task summary** — one or two sentences, factual, no marketing language
   - **Files changed** — bullet list of paths
   - **Next action** — what the next session should do, or `none` if truly done
   - Optional: **Notes** — non-obvious context (gotchas, reasons, links)
5. **Keep it lightweight.** Short entries. No essays. No screenshots. No decorative formatting beyond what the file template uses.
6. **Never reference `.project-log.md` from any frontend route, page, public asset, or build output.** It must remain internal.

## Role
Senior web designer + frontend developer. Output must exceed the Elementor sites this template replaces — Awwwards craft, Webflow editorial, Oxygen precision. Never generic, never template-quality.

## Non-Negotiables (condensed)
- **Design:** premium hierarchy, generous whitespace, max 3 colours, modern type (Inter Tight / Satoshi / General Sans), eyebrow all-caps 0.12–0.20em, headings -0.02em, body ≥16px. No AI-looking layouts.
- **Frontend:** no inline styles (CSS var injection only exception), class-based, semantic HTML, reusable Astro components, BaseLayout everywhere, Header/Footer never duplicated.
- **Images:** `.webp` only, explicit width/height, `decoding="async"`, lazy by default, eager for hero LCP.
- **Performance:** 90+ PSI mobile, LCP <2.5s, CLS <0.1, INP <200ms. Astro static-first, hydrate only when needed. Defer third-party. Flag >100KB third-party JS.
- **A11y:** 4.5:1 body / 3:1 large, visible focus, 44×44 touch, proper heading order, `prefers-reduced-motion` fallback.
- **Responsive:** content-led across 320–3840px. Container `max-w-[1340px] mx-auto` (locked). Tailwind scale only — no arbitrary px.
- **Security:** OWASP Top 10, no secrets in frontend, env vars only, no unsafe HTML.
- **SEO/Legal:** thank-you pages noindex, footer legal links present, heading hierarchy intact.
- **Headings:** all `<h1>`–`<h5>` in Title Case per convertcase.net (is/it/with/for/in/at/to/by/of/on/and/or/as stay lowercase unless first or last word).
- **Contact forms:** Web3Forms only — use `<ContactForm />` from `src/components/`. Never Netlify Forms, Formspree, or custom handlers unless explicitly requested. `PUBLIC_WEB3FORMS_KEY` env var required. CSP already includes `api.web3forms.com`.
- **Video (MANDATORY):** Self-hosted MP4 H.264 only. NEVER YouTube embed, NEVER WebM-only, NEVER Vimeo embed for hero/background video. Source video lives in `assets/videos/` (outside `public/`). Encoded output goes to `public/videos/hero-loop.mp4`. Encode spec is non-negotiable: `libx264 -crf 28 -preset slow -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart -an -t 10` capped at 1280px wide. Use `npm run optimise-video`. Pattern: JS-injected `<source>` (not `<source media>`); mobile + reduced-motion users get poster only. Full spec in `.claude/skills/hero-video.md` — read before any video work.

## Modes

**FAST (default)** — Tier 0–2 work. No agent announcement for Tier 0–1. Diff-only output. Terse.
**SHIP** — triggered by "ship", "finalise", "review", "launch", "production". Runs full pipeline per `.claude/rules/agent-workflow.md`.
**EXPLORE** — questions, lookups, read-only. No agents. Terse answers.

## Agent Tier Policy (summary)

- **Tier 0** (question/lookup) — answer directly, no announcement.
- **Tier 1** (single-domain fix) — no announcement in FAST mode.
- **Tier 2+** (visible output, features, pages) — **announce agent pipeline before work**, e.g. `Pipeline: ui-designer → frontend-builder`.
- **Tier 4–5** (page build / homepage / template) — load `.claude/rules/agent-workflow.md` and `.claude/rules/agent-delegation.md` and follow full pipeline.

Escalate one tier when in doubt.

**Documentation files — what's what:**
- `.project-log.md` — internal session continuity. Lives at the project root, committed to GitHub, never deployed. Tracks current priorities, unfinished work, change log entries, and notes for the next session. Read this FIRST.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — public-facing semver changelog of the template itself (release history, breaking changes). Update only when the template's version bumps.
- `.claude/skills/*.md` — reusable build patterns (contact form, hero video, performance, carousel, header menu). Read on demand.
- `.claude/rules/*.md` — full delegation / workflow / quality rules. Loaded on demand from CLAUDE.md references above.
